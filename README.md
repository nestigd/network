CS50W PROJECT NUMBER 4.
https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/

This is a very simplified social network web app that I'm using to get some practice with Django.
The backbone structure of the website already came in the form of distribution code, so I'm really only adding the view - model - controller part to this.

My next projects will have very little distribution code if any at all.
